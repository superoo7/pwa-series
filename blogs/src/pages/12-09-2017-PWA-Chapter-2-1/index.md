**Progressive Web App** (PWA) is defined in wikipedia as web applications that
use the latest web technologies.

My definition on PWA is more like a practise that a developer take to enhance
User Experience in a website. PWA can be done slowly by adding a couple of
modern web features into any existing web app, to further enhance UX.

The PWA not just focusing on responsive web design, it enhance more on the
experience
